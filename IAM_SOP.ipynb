He came , almost falling forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck thrust out , arms dangling loosely . Then , abruptly , he drew himself up and walked on the very tips of his toes . He stretched his arms over his head and yawned agape ,', 'drawing-in great breaths that became great sighs of ecstacy . \" They have come ! \" he said reverently , gripping his hands together between his knees and leaning forward . \" Isn\\'t it a glorious thing ! Long awaited transcendent event , the exalted desire of all mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the Mind is at hand ! \" He turned beaming eyes upward and shook his head slowly from A superfluous precaution for there was no other car', 'abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait at an intersection for the light to change . At his apartment he garaged his car and then stood listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart Deadly stillness , deadly portent ! Steve awakened early and switched on the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO. The set lighted-up but gave only a low buzzing sound . He had just finished', 'shaving when it came on , with a flat voice repeating : \" This is BBC calling ... this is BBC calling ... \" After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the same empty streets as he had the night before ,', 'to keep an appointment with Heather . Coming around the great mass of the Chateau Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A flying saucer was tilting and dipping over the War Memorial . There was a deep whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing overtone that sang in his ears with an almost painful sharpness . He reversed and turned back on McKenzie Avenue . \" The Thetans , \" he said , \" are presumably here to', 'take charge , as it were , of the minds of the people - who are probably falling all over them- selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry them out . Just what these orders will be , we don\\'t know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es- caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no longer have any immunity . There is just a hope that we may uncover some weakness , and find a way of fighting back at them . \" Heather agreed , and suggested', 'that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra- ting how the Thetan machinations had been working out . It occurred to Steve that this may not have been entirely an objective suggestion on her part ; but he thought it a good idea There can be little doubt that if the Thetans discover our mental independence they will promptly give us their hypnotic treatment . If we can avoid undue prominence , it may be that we can', \"move about pretty freely without detection . If we can - well , then we may be able to promote our own interests . What those interests are , beyond personal security , I haven't a clue ; but , who knows , we may form the nucleus around ... When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action gave the impression of having been thought out and decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while\", 'Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware of their presence . They just stared at him , turning their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and \" Now , to summarize what I think our course of action should be . First , to avoid the Thetans like the plague , for they must not find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily among our own people , finding out just how much freedom we can take with safety . And third , to study these damned Thetans .', \"We must learn all we can about So they proceeded to see if the coast was clear . The street was quiet and deserted , and there were neither sight nor sound of flying saucers . So they ventured forth and made their way on foot to Dan's house . Dan came to the door at their ring but neglected to offer any greeting . He was deeply preoccupied , and it seemed that the\", \"ringing of a doorbell was to him a new and strange phenomenon . His whole attitude was a mixture of impatience pending an awaited communication and of a vague perplexity respecting his surroundings and the purpose he was to serve . Finally , being so obviously on their own , Heather and Steve tried to make themselves at home . Steve switched on Dan's\", \"powerful , world-wide radio and systematically turned the tuning knob through all the tuning points of the world's great radio They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street . But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies . First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of\", 'a single all-exclusive purpose . After a long wait a bus appeared and they followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking seats some rows behind him . Steve was beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy faces very disconcerting ; and looking at Heather he found a welcome relief in her relatively long doleful one Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of real days and would return to New York in late', 'January or early February . Angelina might be a little sorry if we were not back for Christmas as arranged , but he consoled himself by thinking that he and Angelina would have plenty of time together in the future . And Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be back on Moon again , and able to do research at first hand into matters on which the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ... The recovery of his balance was due to the', 'fact that he was living , virtually without expenses , with the people to whom Moke had sent him : little people who regarded him as lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes . Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat ( Stamp Department ) while Sally sulked at home . They had been married for six years , but the salary raise , on the expectation of which they had done so , had not materialised . \" Do you know , I had to send back our bedroom', 'furniture in the second year , \" she moaned . She had contacts in political circles , a school- friend of hers having married Lester Peron , a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the ( literally ) all-powerful Rocket Release Sometimes she took Harry around with her , but never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable . \" I guess Sally made a mistake about me , \" he said one evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal . All Sally\\'s relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom', \"was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo- sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere . One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires , especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's\", 'Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the solar system . True enough , such ultimate weapons had not been used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable that they would be in the next one , Moon and her allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the weapons pronounced conventional . Lester was not home yet from his formidable duties and his wife , in the manner of middle-brow wives , romanced about him in his absence . \" Lester was a country lawyer , and we were very small 4microdebs , weren\\'t we ,', 'Sally \" - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the economic system : that was reverenced - \" when he thought we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics .

The time has come for him to be taken seriously Peron entered , a large man , who had once been handsome but was now seedy-looking , a sufferer', 'from stomach-ulcers . In the Back-Face tradition he wore , and kept on indoors , a fifty gallon hat . Harry was prepared for something unpleasant , for this was the Senator who had annoyed the United States by bragging how he had once won a trick from W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his rockets ( an admission which would scarcely help bluff to succeed the next time ) and , lately , by saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region ,', \"But privately he turned out to be as friendly as Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer , to have the same adolescent openness and freshness , though perhaps not the same maturity . One remembered that he was a lawyer by training , and suspected that the points he made so sharply in international politics were as abstract to him as those a lawyer makes in a court The motive would be the same in both cases , to serve this home of his , in which his heart lay . Here the rocket man's charm was disarming . Yet\", \"when the time came to leave , Harry felt as de- pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office , exactly a month ago . If even Mo statesmen only did what they had to do to get GO on an expan- ding scale , and left the sum-total of their actions , and their lunar and earthly repercussions , to luck ( or to Moke ) , there was a vacuum where there should be a centre of trust , responsible for the maintenance The political life of Aristotle looked more and more like a masquerade of business interests in dis-\", \"guise which , far from attracting the allegiance of free men everywhere , could only repel them . Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per- haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse which might in time become social fact and counteract the obsession with economics which had grown up during the Moon's At the centre of each circle stood personnel managers of corporations , together with professors and their filing clerks . The students had\", 'bought their college education forward and were now being bought forward in their turn . By comparing personal appearances with university records , the agents of the businesses would pick on young men and women who interested them , and contracts would be initialled at the end of Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one worried little man-student who kept getting out of', 'step . He looked as if nothing Moke and his minions could do to him would ever make him GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary neurosis and not in some eruption from those deeper layers in the human psyche which are So once again the metaphysics were depressing , and in absolute contrast to the physical display . Mos have an un-American love of parades , and these young ones , on parade for jobs which they had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally', \"putting their best foot forward .

I had a distinct impression that the', 'hut had recently been cleaned and prepared for visitors . Mrs Caine said we were to go no further unless and until we were sent for , confirming another impression that became more and more definite , namely , that she was in touch with an invi- sible source of authority . Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely Mr Septimus stood in the same case as', \"myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself to entertain for an instant the idea , the strange , the unwelcome , the almost inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival would be inopportune ; and with the idea came a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused , to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ... But all three were to the casual observation I permitted myself unruffled ;\", 'Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very thoughtful , but that was his habit .

NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a single-decker Welsh bus could have got itself into orbit . Shooting up over the pass a bit too carefree , and becoming airborne ? Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A combination of the two ? No one seems', 'to know . But the fact remains that get itself into orbit it did . And a fine old fuss there was about it , too . Here are the known facts . On 10th July , the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl , left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual . Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ; pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball and Miss Ethel Yates , hikers from', \"Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the Yes , the bus set out from Dinas . So much is established . Ifor Huw Evans , Propr. , watched it go from the windows of the Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested , Ifor was . For there was his garage hand , Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of Morfydd Owen . Morfydd , who had until recently been Ifor's typist , but was now returning to her home town as a\", 'fully-fledged schoolteacher . \" But I \\'m only going fifteen miles away , \" Morfydd was saying . \" Not the end of the world , is it ? \" \" For me it is , \" Dai said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his overalls preparatory to a last embrace . \" You will not be remembering a mere garage hand when you are lording it over the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . \" \" Silly boy , \" said Morfydd . Though she', 'could not help wondering whether , now she had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor little Dai was quite the man for her . A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the new world she was entering there might be boys equally nice , and with far more to offer . The conductor rang his bell . \" Good-bye , Dai , \" said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step . \" Good-bye , Morfydd . \" He sought to enfold her in his arms . But he was too late . She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen', 'waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas . So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere , on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller\\'s Joy , rang up the Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their \" Left here all right , \" said Ifor . \" Two-thirty-five , on the dot . \" \" It \\'s supposed to leave at two-twenty . \" \" Who says so ? \" \" Your timetable . \" \" Don\\'t want to take too much notice of those old timetables , \" Ifor said ,', 'reasonably . \" Start running punctual and where are you ? People get left behind , isn\\'t it ? Very exasperating for one and all . \" \" And what are you going to do about it ? \" Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded . \" What do you want me to do ? Send out a sheriff\\'s posse , is it ? \" No sense of humour , that Isaiah . He banged down the receiver . Very uncivil . Dropped the mask , now , Ifor did . \" Dai Pugh , \" he bellowed . \" Leap on your bicycle and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller\\'s Joy . The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to complete her mission . \" Paled , did Dai . For the two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more', 'precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen was , as he feared , departed out of his life , he still loved her dearly . Already , even as with trembling fingers he fastened his trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in some dreadful ravine , or beset by robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency But even his imagination , luckily for him , did not visualise the awful truth - that Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for', 'the title of \" First Woman to Enter Space . \" \" Where are we going , Mam ? \" inquired little Cadwallader when his child mind grasped the fact that the green earth was falling away at a rate of knots . Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply to the conductor , demanding an explanation . But nonplussed , the conductor was . A good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of depth in this particular instance . Fingered', 'his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of the window . Went and consulted the driver . \" Where are we going ? \" he echoed Cadwallader . \" Damned if I know , boy , \" said the driver . \" But something very untoward has happened , if you ask me . \" Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper , folded it , and glanced idly out of the window . Looked again , eyes starting from', 'his head . \" God bless my immortal soul , \" he cried . \" Never mind your immortal soul , \" said Megan Thomas tartly . \" Here we are traversing the heavens at the very moment when we should be running into Llangrwl bus station . And no one doing the first thing about it . \" Stung , the conductor was . \" What you expect me to do ? \" he inquired , bitter . \" Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,', 'is it ? \" \" Mutual recriminations will get us nowhere , \" boomed the Rev. Edwards . \" It \\'s all very well , \" commented Mr. Hayball from the back seat . \" But Eth and me wanted to be at the Youth Hostel before dark . \" Morfydd Owen was silent . But she looked down at the fast-disappearing earth , and it seemed to her that she would never see her Dai again . And', 'though half an hour ago she had regarded this possibility with fortitude , it now filled her with dismay . Quietly she began to Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling furiously on the road . Not a sign of the bus . He passed The Traveller\\'s Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts , walking very dogged towards Llangrwl . \" Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , \" he called , polite ,', \"as he shot past . His spirits were rising . He had seen no sign of an accident . Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken . He would find the bus safe and sound in Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly But disappointment awaited him . A restive queue of people in the bus station , waiting to be transported to Dinas . And when he went to Morfydd's house , all he found was Morfydd's mam , working\", 'herself up proper ... Getting dark , now . The conductor switched on the lights . The beleaguered passengers peered out of the windows . Little to be seen , only a few lone stars , and the distant earth brooding in her shroud of mist . Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing the sleeping Cadwallader . Driver and conductor peered ahead into nothingness . On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced', 'his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The Rev. Edwards , standing at the front , looked at his forlorn flock . \" What about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? \" he suggested hopefully . They looked at him , sullen . His heart sank . If the Welsh found the situation too desperate for singing , then the situation , he realised , must be desperate indeed . But suddenly they were roused', 'from their lethargy . Something was approaching , faster , faster , a tearing hurrying blur that was past and gone in a moment , followed by a great rush of sound . They waved frantically . But the jet aircraft was already miles away , swinging down to the darkening earth . \" It passed me at fifty thousand feet , sir . It was climbing steadily . \" Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the', 'Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his office . \" And what did it look like , Broughtons ? Some Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet . \" Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus . A single-decker , \" he elaborated . Daggers , the Group Captain looked . \" Broughtons , \" he said silkily . \" Didn\\'t they teach you at Cranwell that buses are earth-bound creatures ? Aeroplanes fly , Broughtons . Buses crawl . \" Very pale , Broughtons was . But determined . \" It was a bus , sir .', 'They \\'d got the lights on . There were people inside . Waving . \" Like gimlets , the Station Commander\\'s eyes . \" Did you see the indicator board ? \" \" Yes , sir . \" \" And what did it say ? Mystery Tour ? \" Oh , very caustic , that Group Captain . But Broughtons stood his ground . \" No , sir . It said Llangrwl . \" Llewelyn Jones sat back in his chair . \" I see . So you met a bus at All lit up . Full of people waving as you went past . \" Suddenly he crouched forward . \" Broughtons , if I thought there were anything in Queen\\'s Regulations to cover this ,', 'I \\'d have you court-martialled . But I know there isn\\'t , \" he ended sadly . \" I tried to read the registration number , sir . But it was getting dark . \" He waited . But his commanding officer appeared to \" Then we are saved , \" cried the Rev. Edwards . Shyly , Morfydd Owen produced a block of He saluted , and left the presence , very crestfallen ... Time passed . The bus climbed , and went quietly into orbit . Time passed . The Rev. Edwards\\' pulpit remained empty . And so did the arms of Dai', 'Pugh . How could they be otherwise , when his beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a- quarter-hour intervals , regular as clockwork ? Time passed . Everyone said , \" Pity about Megan Thomas , isn\\'t it , \" as though they didn\\'t really think it was a pity at all ; as , indeed , they didn\\'t . LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the Dinas Advertiser . But the London papers ignored the whole affair . Ifor Evans reported his loss to the police . But they only tut-tutted . \" Lost', 'a bus , is it . Very careless . \" That was their attitude . Now if there \\'d been a good old accident , they could have measured up the road and But losing a bus ! People were always losing things . You \\'d be surprised , they said . So it seemed , for a time , that the whole affair would be written off as one of those unexplained mysteries , like the Marie Celeste . Then things began to happen ... But what about the voyagers ? Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command . \" Our', 'position , \" he said , \" is somewhat analogous to that of a castaway on a desert island . Now what does such a person do ? He signals his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a flag on a palm tree . And he tries to ensure \" Can\\'t go lighting bonfires on this bus , \" the conductor said firmly . \" Contrary to the Company\\'s Regulations . \" \" Of course not , \" agreed the minister . \" No , we have another way of signalling our position . The driver must sound his horn', 'continuously . \" Gave him a look , the driver did . \" Where you think we are ? \" he asked rudely . \" Do as I say , driver . \" Very stern , the reverend gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as through empty space . \" Thank you , \" the Rev. Edwards said courteously . \" Secondly , we must pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . \" He looked at Price the Provisions , who was nursing \" Now , who has any food ? \" he asked hopefully . Stared back did Price the Provisions , unwinking .', '\" Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , \" said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head . \" Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for , too . \" He folded his arms protectively over the basket . Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn\\'t enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure Island . \" What have you got in that basket , Price ? \" he roared . Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and began to read . \" Six loaves , four pounds butter ,', 'two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . \" Bertram\\'s face was grim . \" You think it was the Snort , don\\'t you ? \" John gave a short laugh . \" I did , \" he said ; \" but I \\'d better stop thinking that now . Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . \" \" So there you are , my dear . \" Peggy \\'s eyes filled with tears . \" It \\'s so unfair , \" she said . \" That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the dockyard and now that she \\'s ready for sea he goes', 'sick . Just because he \\'s an Honourable he can do what he likes . Anyway , why pick on you to succeed him ? \" John didn\\'t answer . There was no point in sharing his discomfort with Peggy . Though your wings and your scars are new , you may join us . \\' \\' I am Lily-yo . We three are humans . You are only flymen . We will not join you . \\' The Captives grunted in boredom . The Chief Captive spoke again . \\' Always this talk from you of the Heavy World ! You have', 'joined us . You are flymen , we are human . You I saw several men running down towards the shack . They were all armed with rifles . As the nearest of them came round the shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt . He came up close , eyeing us suspiciously . \" We \\'ve come 2a-calling , \" I said . \" Can\\'t see no reason for calling , \" he said . \" Still long as you \\'re here you may as well stay a while .', '\\'Light an\\' come on in . \" We dismounted and one of the miners who \\'d come along with Nick Dowd took our horses off to water . We followed Nick Dowd into the shack . They \\'d rigged up a stove of sorts and on it a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . Other miners followed in at our heels . Nick Dowd found us a couple of boxes to sit on . A small man in bib overalls and a battered Derby hat fussed around the stove . \" 2Ain\\'t', 'exactly the Ritz Hotel but we \\'ve got our little comforts , \" said Dowd . He introduced the men who \\'d come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick Golightly , Swede and the Sodbuster . This last was the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee sweetened with molasses for all and for us there were two plates of beans . \" They gives you the wind , \" said the Sodbuster handing them to us , \" but it \\'s all we got', 'as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold dust . \" He winked at his partners . They all watched us as we ate the beans . Then when we \\'d finished and I \\'d rolled a cigarette the man called Shorty said , \" You were saying when you came in that 2somep\\'n happened last \" Yes , \" I said . \" Something happened all right . After you \\'d left the meeting , mister \" - I looked across at Nick Dowd - \" someone cut down William Appleton outside the Palace', 'with a shotgun . \" I paused and watched my words affect them in their different ways . \" That \\'s sure bad news , \" said Dowd , sombrely . \" It 2jest about leaves everything wide open for Mr. Pell and his bunch , \" observed The rest of the men there said nothing but you could see they were hard hit . They were simple men who knew a lot maybe about digging for gold but were babes in arms when it came to dealing with owlhooters and', 'desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the rest . \" I guess we \\'d better hold onto the gold right 2hyar , Nick , \" said the Sodbuster . \" Yeah , \" said Dowd dubiously . \" 2Mebbe we \\'d better . \" Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at that point . \" If you do , \" he said , \" you \\'ll be sure asking for trouble . They \\'ll be on your necks before you can say \\' knife \\' . It wouldn\\'t be the first time they \\'ve held up a diggings at gun point either . They \\'ve done it before', 'and got away with it . \" \" You \\'re 2durned tootin\\' , mister , \" said the man called Roper Smith . \" We \\'ve got five rifles among us and a few six-shooters .

All who make the journey from', \"the Heavy World become changed . Some die . Most live and grow wings . Between the worlds are many strong rays , not seen or felt , which change our bodies . When you come here , when you come to the True World , you become a true human . The grub of the tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes . So humans change . ' ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said stubbornly , throwing himself down . But Lily-yo and ' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , ' Lily-yo said , doubtingly . The Captive with the\", \"fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' ' You are still young , ' said the Chief Captive . ' You begin newly here . Where are your souls ? ' Lily-yo and Flor looked at each other . In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had heedlessly thrown down their souls . Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable ! ' You see . You needed them no more . You are still young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with\", \"the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong , as we are . Some may be born right . ' ' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move well we can - think . This tribe of the True World is good and knows these things . So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo\", \"muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? ' The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected , making his perpetual little gesture of protest , ' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because we are Captives , we have the time to talk and think and plan and know . Those who know command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will\", \"come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added . ' You will live among us and enjoy your life free ' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths . ' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless - must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi asked . ' What else ? Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive here at a good time . Memories of the Heavy World and its savage life are still fresh in you . We need such memories . So we ask you to go\", \"back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? ' gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to Motion there was , but motion without event - except for those negligible events that seemed so large to the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated\", \"with their wings soon died away as the wonderful new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had been inclined to regard women as something which must necessarily be subordinated to his career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl whom he had never met and on whom after no more\", 'than a couple of telephone calls he was prepared to place complete reliance . \" Good luck , Air Marshal , \" she said gently . \" I \\'ll be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you both at midnight . \" They might have been arranging a supper party . Then she rang off . Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether uneventful life had he come across a girl who sounded so charming and appeared to be so', 'It was a novel experience . Alastair was quite unable to explain why he should feel so much confidence in her . Once again she checked back her instructions . It was obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the faith which he was placing in her and was prepared to accept the responsibility . For some reason the orderlies had forgotten to switch on the lights ; there was no colour - physical features were distinguishable solely by', 'gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow- capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles below , was not recognisable among the host of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots flickered across its surface , but there was In the exceptional clarity he was even able to make a direct comparison between the radar image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the', 'left , Milan . The directional angle of the scanner could be adjusted to cover any particular area within its range . Geoffrey turned the scale slowly to cover the ground immediately ahead . Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft dipped slightly . The needle of the speed recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0 before coming to rest at 5.0 . \" We \\'re a bit', 'ahead of time , \" said Alastair . \" We \\'ll run in on minimum engine power . \" Geoffrey smiled . Alastair talked of running in when they were still more than four hundred miles from their destination . He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle', \"was resting could really mean hundreds of knots . They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port . He was able to trace the course of the river ; he thought he could recognise the route of N12 , along which he had motored so desperately little more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then he had flown to England , attended the vital conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked by special helicopter from the Horse Guards\", 'Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds of the journey back to the place where every indication pointed to Eve being held . Geoffrey set himself to consider the movements of the Bentley . It had passed him at the temporary bridge over the Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the previous night . He worked out the distance on the presumption that its route had been', \"through Florence and Rome and then across Italy via Foggia to Barletta . It came to just over six hundred DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy , made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that the party was over . Piers came strolling out to meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had driven away , invited them casually to come to\", '\" Oh , she was due ! \" And then he added in the same casual tone , \" She \\'s not returning to her family . She \\'s going to live with friends of the bank manager , just this side of Belleray . \" Mrs. Deane made a suitable comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering with anger against her she had no doubt . To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent', 'reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling . But it did not take her long to realise that his mood was less pleasant than appeared on the surface . He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family - to come over and make the presentation in her stead . \" I caught him just as he was going to the airport to meet Blanche , \" he said . \" As a matter of fact I \\'d asked him last night to deputise', 'for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party too . They \\'re both here . \" \" I didn\\'t know she was coming back from Barbados so soon . \" Beryl said the first thing that came into her head . Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to express their disgust at Sir John\\'s abominable treatment of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl suggested having a second party , the following week , he poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared , had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them', 'nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile Hubert would have betaken himself and his well- earned gratuity to his native village at the \" It \\'s your superior attitude that riles me . \" Beryl was scarlet with annoyance . \" How I happened to be marooned at Balicou doesn\\'t interest you in the faintest degree . You look as though it was only what you expected of me , as though I didn\\'t care a hoot about letting Hubert It was all over and done with . For the time being Beryl was content to let', 'it go at that , but she resolved to have it out with Piers when a reasonable opportunity presented itself . He must learn that he could not treat her with injustice and contempt , ignoring her explanations as though he were a schoolmaster and she a small , He gave her no chance of any private conversation that evening , for when Blanche and Jack left , he went with', 'them . But next morning she insisted on his taking her out in the jeep - to find , if possible , Hubert and his relations , and tell them of her great disappointment at being held up in Balicou . With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his Boxer , to the back , and made room for her beside him . \" Is that all you want to do ? \" he asked , letting in the clutch . \" No ; I want', 'to make you understand just what happened about this Balicou trip , \" she returned coldly . \" I \\'m a little tired of being treated like an ineffective imbecile . \" \" And I \\'m heartily sick of being constantly called to account for my manners , \" he retorted . \" What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack to make the presentation , I run the damned party to the best of my ability - saying the', 'sugary things you ought to have been there to say - and all you can do is to find \" As your employee it \\'s not my business to understand all the whys and wherefores of your actions , \" he said stiffly . \" Still less to criticise you . \" \" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers ! Be yourself , \" she exclaimed , with mounting exasperation . \" Very well ! \" He brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough', 'path fringed and shaded by citrus trees . \" If you want my true opinion I \\'ll give it . You made some sort of a protest to Graybury . I \\'ll give you credit for that . But you didn\\'t press the matter because , very naturally , you were thoroughly enjoying Forrest\\'s company in idyllic surroundings . \" \" How dare you say such a thing ? \" she blazed . \" For goodness\\' sake show a glimmer of reason , \" was his equally indignant rejoinder .', '\" You talk as though we were alone on Balicou ! \" She avoided his gaze , and tried to ignore that last impertinent remark . \" With four other people - \" \" Whom you never once managed to circumvent . \" The mockery in his voice had deepened . \" With all due deference , Miss Deane - come off it ! \" She met his eyes then . She wavered , and at last said slowly , \" If you must drag the truth out of me , I must ask you to regard', 'it as confidential . \" \" My dear Beryl , don\\'t tell me anything , if you \\'d rather not . \" He was clearly startled by her words . \" But remember , it was you , not I , who started this conversation . \" \" Neither can Nigel , \" smiled Diana . \" He \\'s saving up to get married . Remember ? \" \" I remember , \" quipped the houseman , meaning no offence , \" but does he ? That blonde was something . \" \" Anybody', 'I know ? \" she smiled . \" I think so . I got a good look at her . But if Nigel wasn\\'t there it isn\\'t important , is it ? \" \" No , \" Di said immediately . \" It isn\\'t at \" Oh , he wasn\\'t . His motor-bike had broken down outside and he noticed your car and then you dancing with this blonde . \" \" Really ? \" Nigel cocked one eyebrow . \" Actually she was brunette at the roots and I had a redhead on', 'the other arm .

Because it was your car I suppose he presumed it was you , all dressed up in \" My white or my black ? \" Nigel enquired . \" Now I wonder which I wore at that particular surgery ? \" \" You are a fool , darling , \" Di said happily . \" I shall take great pleasure in telling that young man', 'exactly what you were doing that evening . \" \" No , don\\'t , \" he said , after kissing her again . \" I rather like to have the housemen think of me as a I \\'m such a dull fellow , really . \" \" Dull ? \" She couldn\\'t believe it . Self-deprecation was not one of Nigel\\'s usual attributes . \" You need your holiday , darling . I only wish I could go with you ! \" \" Doctor Wills , if you \\'re making improper suggestions ... ? \"', '\" It would make me more interesting , I suppose ? \" she enquired archly . \" No , it wouldn\\'t ! \" he almost snapped , surprising her . \" You sounded like some- body else for a moment there . It doesn\\'t become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . \" \" Nigel - ! \" she gasped . \" I didn\\'t mean to behave like anything of the kind . I was only joking . \" \" Well , don\\'t .

Their air of smiling somnolence showed them to have been guests at yesterday's celebrations , and their friendly welcome and warm sympathy , as she explained how she had come to miss the party , made her send a complacent glance in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the man was , she thought impatiently ,\", 'trying to worry her into the belief that her failure to appear at a function on the estate was a major error : And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her in halting 6patois that \" 3Mistah Piers \" had explained right at the start that \" 3Mis\\' Beryl \" would be 3\" plenty , plenty sad \" not to be back That it wouldn\\'t be her fault at all .

That damned fool boy ! What does he mean by trying to come home now , even if he did promise ? What does time mean when weighed against the life of two human beings ? \" Not until he was certain that the yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of being flung against the huge boulders did the judge empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them with part of that howling northwest gale .
